    It's been a while since I've written anything. Just been too busy to find the time for keeping the blog up to date. The plus side of that is I've been busy with work. As business goes, I think I'm finally starting to hit my stride. I'm starting to get more responses to my ads (which, I think, probably has to do with people googling me after reading the ads and finding this blog), I'm starting to get more (and better) responses when I reply to other people's ads, and the specific jobs I've been getting are all of the sort that are likely to lead to a longer lived professional relationship. I think the most frustrating thing about this whole venture of mine so far has been the frequency with which people simply <strong>do not respond</strong> when I contact them about a job they're advertising. I understand that they might be busy, or might have already found someone else to do it, but is a quick, two-line courtesy email too much to ask? I'll admit, I've probably managed to unintentionally snub a person or two (which reminds me, I have a phone call to return when I get back to Boston), but having had to deal with it disturbingly often myself I really do try and make sure that everyone gets at least some response. But at least it seems to be happening less and less often now. I have to wonder if that is related to my recent upturn in business lately. Perhaps I'm actually starting to build a reputation and am looking more credible to potential clients. One can only hope. Well, one could also retain a PR firm/person, but I don't quite have the budget for that yet. It's a good thing I happen to live with Boston's foremost expert in internet and word-of-mouth marketing.

For now, and until Monday, however, <a href="http://www.whippersnapr.com/blog">Jessi</a> and I are in Santa Fe visiting my mom. I like it here. My mom's house is maybe 25 minutes outside of the actual city, off a dirt road in the middle of the desert. It's about a 12 acre property, surrounded by a small community of similar properties. Most people around here, including my mom, have horses which means they also tend to keep things pretty quiet and relaxed. It's a great place to go and just do nothing for a while, which can make for a very nice break from being in Boston and running a business (or two). The weather's also been fantastic. Today it was 75Â° and sunny. Compared to the rain and even snow Boston's been getting today. I even managed to remember to bring my camera, so hopefully I'll be able to spend some time just wandering around the desert taking pictures. I've already found a few good shots I want to go back to with the camera later. (And a few that could be great, but not until I get a better camera. The one I'm using doesn't even have manual focus, let alone aperture priority or anything fun like that.)

Well, guess it's back to some more relaxing before dinner.
