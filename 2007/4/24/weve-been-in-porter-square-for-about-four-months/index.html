    and I'm still continually finding things that make me like it here even more.

Moving to Boston from San Francisco, I was a little worried that I'd be giving up the amazing variety and quality of food that was available to me. I was particularly concerned about Mexican food. Fortunately, it didn't take long for Jessi to introduce me to <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/Whh9-r1AKYA5r4W2a8pnJA">Anna's Taqueria</a>, a burrito joint that makes burritos almost identical to those at <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/zub6pgnoXv_PdwYi2KBDLw">Gordo Taqueria</a>, my favorite burrito place in San Francisco (and it's been said that the owners are related, certainly their menus are). I won't say that it was a condition of choosing this condo, but the fact that there's an Anna's right down the street from us certainly made this location a little more amenable to me. Then, after we moved here, we discovered <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/3iZmwOXfSWmPX7Xp_m41gQ">Tacos Lupita</a>, a Salvadorean restaurant that's also within easy walking distance of our condo and which serves absolutely amazing food (though not quite Mexican).

I've since put together a rather extensive list of good-sounding restaurants around us to try. One of the places on that list was <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/QtFM-miP8xQAXbTzD1hvlA?hrid=6MJSBiU2J8bEXHDZwtzZUg">The Half-Shell</a> which is actually right down the street from us. I'm a huge fan of gyros, and they have a sign advertising their gyros right out front, so I'd been meaning to give them a try for a while. This afternoon I went to get a haircut (<a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/HzSL6QI1bdZX2-I_VSiTgw">Charlie's Barber Shop</a> is a really good barber shop that's also right down the street from us) and decided to stop in at Half-Shell and finally give their gyro a try. It was really good, but that's not the best part. The best part, is that they serve <em>gyro pizza</em>.

I first had gyro pizza while I was a student at <a href="http://www.carleton.edu">Carleton College</a> in Minnesota. I was immediately a fan. Sadly, I'd never, until now, found a place that serves it outside of Minnesota. One of the reasons I was looking for a place around here that has good gyro is so I could try and get them to make me a gyro pizza for me. But now, my search is over. If you've never had a gyro pizza before, I <em>highly</em> recommend you head over to Half-Shell and give it a shot. Now that I know there's one, there's probably other places around that serve it too, I'll have to try and put together a list, because I'm definitely going to be insisting that all my friends in the Boston area give it a try.
