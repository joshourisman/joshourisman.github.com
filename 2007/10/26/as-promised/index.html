    </h1>
    ...my account of <a href="http://bostonblogevents.com/blogtoberfest/">Blogtoberfest 2007</a>.

As expected it was a lot of fun. There were a ton of people there, far too many to be able to actually have any sort of real conversation with even most of them. In addition to our illustrious host <a href="http://www.alleyesonjenny.com/">Jenny</a>, I was able to meet a number of area bloggers for the first time including: <a href="http://www.thetastyshow.com/">Dana Zemack</a>, <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/projectfailures/">Michael Krigsman</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/misc">Jesse Baer</a>, <a href="http://mlamasslib.blogspot.com/">Andrea Mercado</a>, and a few others whose names and/or URLs I sadly can't remember. All in all, there were actually only three bloggers that whom I had met before: <a href="http://www.jesselegg.com">Jesse Legg</a>, <a href="http://stevegarfield.com/">Steve Garfield</a>, and <a href="http://www.universalhub.com/">Adam Gaffin</a>. From the sound of things most of the people there were meeting a bunch of new people as well.

The highlight of the evening was probably the raffle. Everyone who attended put their name in a hat (well, bowl) for a chance to win a number of prizes including a beautiful print of Fenway Park shot by Jenny herself. As per usual, I didn't win a thing, although both of the two people standing to my left at the time won things, as did at least two other people I had been talking to throughout the night. I'll just try and claim credit for that.

Afterwards Jesse (Legg) and I made our ways back to Somerville via TC's Lounge and the Newtowne Grill. A good night, I think, was had by all.

In other news, I think it's safe to say that it's officially starting to get almost kinda cold here. It looks like Monday will be the first day that the temperature doesn't even break 50Â°, although overnight temperatures appear to be remaining strictly above freezing for the foreseeable future (at least according to the weather widget in my dashboard). I did, however, actually turn on the heat today for the first time in months. The furnace hasn't actually kicked in yet as the residual heat from the day is still keeping us above the 65Â° I set the thermostat to, but it probably will within the next 30 minutes or so. I also bothered to take the time to figure out how to program a schedule into the thermostat. It's a much more useful feature than I thought, letting me program in 4 distinct periods for weekdays (delineated by Sleep, Wake, Leave, and Return), and 2 periods for weekends (Sleep and Wake). This actually works out rather well since despite the fact that I work from home and so will want the heat to be on during the day, I prefer a much cooler temperature than <a href="http://www.whippersnapr.com/blog">Jessi</a> does. Thanks to the programmed in schedule the condo will only be too warm before Jessi leaves for work in the morning and after she gets home at night leaving it nice and comfortable for me during the bulk of the day.
