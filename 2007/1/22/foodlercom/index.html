    As I mentioned in my last post I've just discovered <a href="http://www.foodler.com/">Foodler.com</a>. Foodler is basically a website that lets your order directly from local restaurants for pickup or delivery. This is hardly a new idea, I used to do it all the time with Food.com back before it became the Food Network's website, but, despite the lack of novelty, I was still very impressed by Foodler.

It not only does what you'd expect it to do, but it does it very well. It's all AJAXy, so the pages are dynamic and very smooth to use. But I think my favorite thing about it is that once you register an account and give it your address, it greets you with a list of places that will deliver to your address <em>and are open</em>. The main page shows you three categories: Open and delivering, Open for takeout, and Closed restaurants. This was an incredibly useful feature the other night when <a href="http://www.whippersnapr.com/blog">Jessi</a> and I were trying to find a place that would deliver to our new condo at midnight. Once we put our address in it narrowed down the selections only to places that would deliver to our specific address (fewer than to our zip code) as well as to the places that were still open (there were about three total).

It also provides ratings, so we were able to easily choose between the two Chinese places that were available. The ratings appear to be pretty accurate, because the one we went with, <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/ZkE3etKVwchoGVm61I74RQ">Happy Garden</a> was <em>fantastic</em>. Their service was quick, their prices were good, and their food was definitely the best I've had on the East Coast, and possibly the best I've had outside of China. For anyone in the Somerville area, I highly recommend you try it out. And if you're too lazy/busy to go there, just order your dinner online with Foodler. You won't be disappointed.
