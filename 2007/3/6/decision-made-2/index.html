    I'm now banking with Wainwright Bank. Well, technically I'm now banking with Wainwright Bank in addition to Bank of America (not going to put all my money with Wainwright until I get my ATM card...). I decided that the few small things against the smaller banks weren't really that big a deal. And I actually decided that I don't care that they don't have e-Bills, because I've realized that it's been much harder to keep track of my spending without the paper copies. As for why I chose Wainwright over Leader, well it was really just a gut decision. Wainwright has a few more locations near me, which is nice, but in the end I just felt a little better about them. Highly scientific, I know.

I also took this opportunity to finally open some business accounts. Wainwright offers a free small business checking account, which is nice, so I went ahead and did that. I've been meaning to do it for a while as I want to make it easier to keep my business and personal finances separately, and it was pretty easy to do since I was already in the bank opening personal accounts. Another fun perk of having done this is that I can now accept checks made out to Derivative Technologies Consulting. (If I really wanted to, I probably could have done that before by just showing them my business certificate, but it's just easier this way.)

I've only been with Wainwright for a day now, so I can't really say much about them yet. But when I went in and spoke with a banker about opening my accounts they were very friendly and helpful. Their online banking is a bit basic, but it does all the important stuff. I do have to say that it will be nice to be finished with Bank of America. Even if they hadn't screwed me over on that $10,000, I prefer working with smaller, local businesses. Hopefully thing will go well with Wainwright, I've certainly heard nothing but good things about them.
