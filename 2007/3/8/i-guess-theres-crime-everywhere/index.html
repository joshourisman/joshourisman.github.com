    If you've been reading my blog for a while, you may remember that shortly after I moved into the apartment in Central Square that we were living in previously <a href="http://www.joshourisman.com/2006/08/13/shots-fired-hey-look-im-a-journalist/">there was a shooting right across the street</a>. One of the reasons <a href="http://www.whippersnapr.com/blog">Jessi</a> and I were so eager to move out of that apartment and into our new place in Porter Square was because the apartment was in a fairly high crime area. While Porter Square is certainly safer and has less crime than Central Square, we're not completely free of crime here, sadly.

Our condo is the top floor of a triple-decker. The other night, someone broke into the first floor unit in our building. Apparently they broke a lock on one of the windows to get in, took whatever they took, and then just waltzed out the back door (actually, I imagine they probably snuck more than they waltzed, but waltzing is just so much more poetic). I'm not sure, but it may have been the same incident reported on <a href="http://bachelorinporter.blogspot.com/index.html">The Bachelor in Porter Square</a>: <a href="http://bachelorinporter.blogspot.com/2007/03/crime-in-porter-square.html">Crime in Porter Square</a>. Sadly our first floor neighbor had taken his dog to work with him that day, or this probably wouldn't have happened. What makes it a little scary, however, is that at the time of the break-in the woman who lives on the second floor was in the shower (she heard the thieves talking in the back stairwell when she got out). I was also home, on the third floor, but was busy working and didn't hear a thing sadly.

There are, of course, a lot of easy things we can do to prevent this from happening again. First, we can replace the locks on the first floor windows and doors with better ones. Second (and this is something we want to do anyway) we can put better lights at the front and back doors, and put them on motion sensors. Despite this one incident, I don't really think an alarm is necessary, but it's also always an option. We could also get some NRA stickers to put on the windows (and I, for one, wouldn't mind backing those stickers up with fact).
