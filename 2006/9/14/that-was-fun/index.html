      <a href="" rel="bookmark">That was fun</a>
      <br />
      <small>Sep 14, 2006</small>
    </h1>
    The <a href="http://bmac.org/">BMAC</a> meeting last night turned out to be pretty fun and worthwhile. The presenter for the night was <a href="http://www.glorifiedtypist.com/">Rich Siegel</a> the guy who wrote <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bbedit">BBEdit</a> (pretty much <em>the</em> text editor for coders working on Macs) and started <a href="http://www.barebones.com/">Bare Bones Software</a>. He talked about the changes in <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/">the latest major update (8.5) of BBEdit</a> as well as their relatively new product, <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/yojimbo/index.shtml">Yojimbo</a>.

Being a long-time Mac user, BBEdit has pretty much always been on the radar. Although, to be honest, I've never really used it (I generally use <a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/">SubEthaEdit</a> for my coding when I'm not using <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>). But after his talk about it, I'm seriously considering it. Two of the features in particular (folding and clippings) really caught my attention. I'm definitely going to give a try on my next project to test it out and see if it's worth the somewhat hefty price tag of $125.

I'm also giving Yojimbo a try. I looked at it when they first released it about 6 months ago and didn't really see the point. Since then, however, I've often wished I had a good program to use as a repository for all that random information you tend to accumulate like serial numbers and passwords. There are a number of solutions out there such as SOHO Notes (which I can get for free, but don't really like), but after last night I obviously have Yojimbo in mind and so am giving it a shot. Fortunately it's much cheaper ($39), so if I decide I like it there won't be much reason not to get it.

In other news, I just got my copy of OS X Server in the mail thanks to the highly discounted prices offered by the <a href="http://consultants.apple.com/">Apple Consultants Network</a>. I'm planning on installing it on my PowerMac G5 to use as a home server (as well as a testbed for various other things), but first I want to make some hardware upgrades to the machine to better suit it's new role. In particular, I want to move the two 160 GB hard drives currently in it into an external enclosure (probably <a href="http://eshop.macsales.com/item/Other%20World%20Computing/MEPDBSATA/">this one</a> with an eSATA PCI-X card) and configure them into some sort of RAID (haven't decided yet) as a backup store, then put some bigger drives into the internal bays (possibly two 500s, maybe two 250s). Should be a fun project, and will definitely make it easier for me to keep on top of my OS X server skills. I've also got a few ideas for hosted services that I could offer with a setup like this, although I'd want faster, more reliable internet and some hefty UPSs first.

Also, for those of you who may care, there's a new episode of <a href="http://www.uthtv.com/profile/Vermis/">Vermis</a>. As of right now it's not showing up on the site, but it should be soon. An interesting note on this episode is that I got a writing credit (I can do creative stuff too!).
