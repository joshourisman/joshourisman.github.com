      <a href="" rel="bookmark">Political bloggers, post celebration</a>
      <br />
      <small>Oct 30, 2006</small>
    </h1>
    Just got back from the <a href="http://www.joshourisman.com/2006/10/27/celebration-of-political-bloggers/">aforementioned</a> <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/thursdaymeetings/2006/10/25#a571">Celebration of political bloggers</a>. It was very cool, much cooler than I expected actually. I wasn't really sure what to expect, though I was hoping there would be some big names there. I got more than I expected and met: <a href="http://www.stevegarfield.com/">Steve Garfield</a>, <a href="http://www.bluemassgroup.org">David Kravitz</a>, <a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/">David Weinberger</a>, <a href="http://www.dfacambridge.org/blog">Shai Sachs</a>, and others. Sadly, I'm horribly bad at names and have forgotten a few good ones. Also sadly, and more on this in a bit, I had no business cards on me to give to the several people who asked me for them. One thing they should definitely do, which I suppose they still could and if they don't I might offer to start doing it for the future meetings which I attend (and I intend to start attending their <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/thursdaymeetings/">regular Thursday meetings</a> with some regularity), is, after the meeting, send an email to everyone who attended listing the names and blogs of everyone who was there. I think that for those people who don't have cards and those that have poor memories for names it would really increase the value of the meetings. The meetings normally take place on Thursdays at the Berkman Center at Harvard Law School: <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/thursdaymeetings/">link</a>. I recommend it for anyone who's into blogging. <a href="http://www.whippersnapr.com">Jessi</a> also really enjoyed it, expect a good post from her about it in the near future.

I'm really excited about having met Steve Garfield. He's a big name, and doing some very cool stuff. Plus, there's an immediate business connection: he shot <a href="http://stevegarfield.blogs.com/videoblog/2006/10/deval_patrick_j.html">this video</a> on <a href="http://nokiatestcenter.blogspot.com/index.html">his cell phone</a>. I don't know what it is, but something about that piqued my curiosity as Editor in Chief of <a href="http://www.cellphonetechnews.com">cellphonetechnews.com</a>. If I can just put my finger on what it is, maybe I'll write a story about it...

Now back to Kinko's and my lack of business cards. In preparation for this event specifically I wanted to make sure I had some business cards to hand out. I knew it would be a stretch, but I called Kinko's this morning and asked them if it would be possible for me to have some cards printed up by 5pm if I brought them right in (it's a 10 minute walk from my apartment). They said sure, just come by with a PDF, no problem. So I did. They said they'd have it ready by 5, and I figured I was good to go. Three o'clock rolls around and I figure that they, as they often do, might have finished the job early. So I gave them a call. The guy who answered the phone says to me 'oh, well I left you a message'... no, actually you didn't ... 'you need to re-create the PDF because the way it is now we can't do it'. Um, great. And you couldn't tell me this when I brought it in and we looked at the PDF together and you told me it wouldn't be a problem? I wasn't planning on using Kinko's for my business cards anyway, they're just convenient and fast, but now I'll definitely be getting them printed up elsewhere. My dad actually recommended a place a while ago that he used for his cards, but I can't remember the name of it and for some reason Spotlight has been completely useless lately. Oh well, he'll probably see this and remind me of it. (Hi dad!) The plus side is that I've recently come up with what I think is a much better design for the business cards anyway, so now I won't have to print any up with the old design.
