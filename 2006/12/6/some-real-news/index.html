    I haven't been writing much lately, just too much going on. I'm very close to getting my first client who will hire me on retainer rather than just for projects, I'm trying to keep on top of various opportunities to pursue for the new web venture as soon as all the paperwork for that is all ship shape and Bristol fashion (as an old boss of mine would say), trying mightily to find the time to get the work needed on <a href="http://www.cellphonetechnews.com">cellphonetechnews.com</a> done so that it can really launch, and, of course, buying a house.

If you had told me when I started this blog, way back on June 21, that today I would be buying a house, I would have thought you were crazy. None the less, this evening <a href="http://www.whippersnapr.com/blog">Jessi</a> and I will be signing the Purchase and Sale agreement for our new condo in Somerville (and you'll notice that I now have a <a href="http://www.joshourisman.com/category/somerville/">Somerville category</a> to complement my <a href="http://www.joshourisman.com/category/cambridge/">Cambridge one</a>), and handing over a cheque for more money than I've ever actually seen at one time before. Of course things won't really be finalized until Closing, which will be happening mid-January to avoid complications with the holidays, but the really important step of signing the paperwork and handing over a lot of money happens today (and we're meeting with our mortgage broker tomorrow morning to deal with that aspect).

<div style="width:240px;text-align:right;float:right;margin-left:10px;"><a href="http://beta.zooomr.com/photos/joshourisman/497881/" title="Zooomr Photo Sharing :: Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.zooomr.com/images/497881_ee58e2e6b0_m.jpg" width="240" height="186" alt="Move" border="0" style="border:1px solid #000;" /></a></div>So once again, this blog will be chronicling a move. This time I'll be moving less than 2 miles as opposed to the more than 3,000 before, but I think it's just as big a move in other ways. We're moving from renting to owning, a big enough step in its own right, but more importantly we're moving from a temporary residence in the area to a commitment to stay here. We had always planned to stay here for probably at least 5 years, but now that we'll own our condo it's a little more official, and much harder for us to just up and leave if we feel like it. So for the next 5 to 7 years, we'll be living in Somerville. Other than college, this is probably the first time I've ever really decided that I'd be staying in one place for any extended period of time. The only question that remains is: How will <a href="http://beta.zooomr.com/smartsets/joshourisman/3093">Pigpen</a> handle all this?

The process of buying a house is a very strange and convoluted one. I guess I had always imagined it as being like buying anything else: you find what you want, negotiate a price, and buy it. Instead it's a long, involved process that involves hiring several different people to manage it for you, takes about a month, and involves several discreet steps any one of which could fail and bring the whole deal crashing down. I suppose, despite its apparent complexity, that it's really probably one of the most well-honed business practices there is. People have been purchasing land for thousands and thousands of years, so all these steps are probably there for a reason and serve a very good purpose. I definitely intend to write more about the process, and our experience with it, in more detail, but I'm waiting until it's all over so I can collect my thoughts on it.

And so, I'll leave you with this:

An example of just how important editing is to film and our impressions of it.
