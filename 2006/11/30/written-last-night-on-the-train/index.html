    I realized it's been a while since I've talked about what was supposed to be a main focus of this blog: my business. In the past few months, <a href="http://www.dydxtech.com">dy/dx tech</a> has actually really started to take off. It took a little longer than I had expected and hoped, but I'm now actually starting to get people responding to my ads. By far, my best performing ads have been those on <a href="http://www.craigslist.org">Craigslist</a> and those on the <a href="https://www.universalhub.com/bban/">Boston Blogs Ad Network</a>. I was putting a few up on Google, but because of the commonness of my keywords it was getting tot he point where I would just have to spend more on the ads than is really worth it. Fortunately, advertising has never been a big part of my marketing plan.

And, of course, I have my other projects. <a href="http://www.cellphonetechnews.com">Cellphone Tech News</a>, as some may have noticed, has not been updated in a while. This is for a couple of reasons. The main one is that dy/dx tech has kept me pretty busy in the last couple weeks, but in addition, I really want to make some improvements to the site before it really goes live. Currently it's just a collection of static HTML files. Functional, but only just. My first step, one that I've been working on this week, is to replace that with a fully-featured, modern CMS. Originally I was thinking I'd just do it in <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>, but after talking to a few other people about it I've decided to look into <a href="http://joomla.org/">Joomla!</a>. I took at look at Joomla! before when it was in it's infancy and wasn't particularly impresed. But it definitely seems to be in a better state now and I've installed it on a test server to play around with. If anyone out there has any experience with Joomla!, particularly with modifying the layout and writing themes for it, I would very much like to talk with them.

In addition to dy/dx tech and Cellphone Tech News, I've got one other project that I'm working on. In typical fashion, this one is also large-scale. Without going into too much detail, I'll just say that the phrase 'high-end web design' doesn't do it justice. I am, at this very moment, on a train from Boston to New Haven, CT, where I will be meeting with some friends of mine (the guys behind <a href="http://www.collegepokerassociation.com">College Poker Association</a>) to hammer out some of the details so we can get this project off the ground (and yes, the CPA website is an example of the sort of talent that we'll be bringing to the table). Be ready to hear a lot about this new project in the near future.

So overall, I'd say I'm doing pretty well. Within 6 months of leaving my last job, I'm now owner or part-owner of three businesses, all of which have the potential to be very successful, not to mention several other major achievements which I'll save for another time.
