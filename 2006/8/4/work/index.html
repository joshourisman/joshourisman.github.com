    Yesterday I went into work with <a href="http://www.whippersnapr.com/blog">Jessi</a> to help out with a simple IT issue they were having at her office. It took me all of maybe 3 minutes to actually finish what I had come in for (and I don't really plan on even charging them for it), but I ended up spending the day there anyway. This turned out to be a good thing because I was able to spend some time talking to her bosses and should hopefully have a little more work coming my way from them in the future. So I've now done my first work as a freelancer and, pending discussion when the bosses come back from vacation, am soon to have my first official client. And this during my first week when I was 'on vacation' too.

It seems to me that this first client is extremely important. Not only because it means that I'm actually going to be bringing in some money, but it will be my first taste of what freelancing is like. It will be interesting because I really have no choice but to experiment with them and try and figure out the best way for me to do business, but at the same time I can't be too inconsistent and I certainly can't take my experimentation too far. It also is my first chance to start establishing a name and reputation for myself. If I do well and I impress them I can, at the very least, use them as a reference for future clients, and if I'm really lucky they'll even refer potential new clients to me.

I've also been thinking a lot more about my DBA. Currently all I've got is my own name to do business under. That's works just fine, but it just seems to me that it would be better to have a company rather than just an individual. It certainly would make for some more interesting business cards (which I really need to remember to design and print up...) and it will be more versatile moving forward if I end up doing well and hiring people. Plus then I can say I own my own company. I think I'm getting close to having one, but I'm still not really happy with it. Maybe when I've narrowed it down to a few options I'll post another poll and see what everyone else thinks. Oh well, we'll see, but now it's time to go catch my bus.
