    Today was certainly a big day: my last day at work. This last week has been strange in several ways. Obviously there's the sadness of leaving all my friends I've made there mixed with the excitement of everything that's happening. On top of that, work itself has been strange. There was a bit of ramping up leading up to this as people wanted to make sure everything got taken care of, but then for the past two days there's been very little work for me to do. Today I took care of a few last things, but mostly just said my goodbyes, had a nice lunch with the one co-worker who could drag herself away, had my exit interview, my last weekly Friday meeting, packed up my stuff, and left.

Going into it, I really had no idea what to expect from the exit interview. It's not something I'd done before, and it really seemed a somewhat strange concept. But the reality of it was very different from my expectations; it was actually <em>fun</em>. Our HR manager is absolutely wonderful, and she and I share a very quirky sense of humor (for example, we're both incredibly amused by my YouTube playlist <a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=D0A843C1D833006D">The Hoff</a>). Although the interview had it's serious moments and there was genuine discussion about what I thought was good and bad about the job and company, I think we probably spent about 50% of the time laughing. I don't know how one is supposed to feel about an exit interview, but I really enjoyed mine.

At the Friday meeting, along with all the normal mundane details of what happened that week, I was also presented with a going away card and gift. As with the interview, this part was just fun. The card they gave me is an absolute riot. Rather than your typical goodbye card, the message on the front is 'Mazel Tov on your bar mitzvah'. It must have taken me a good 10 seconds of laughter before I was able to straighten up and actually open the card to see the message 'Today is your first aliyah- your first step toward manhood. May each step of your life and each reading of the Torah lead you to greater wisdom and joy. Congratulations on your wonderful achievement'. Given my aforementioned quirky sense of humor, I really don't think there could have been a more appropriate card. And the gift was also great. A gift certificate to <a href="http://www.grill23.com/">Grill 23</a>, my favorite restaurant in Boston which serves by far the best steak I've ever had in my life.

I really did have amazingly great coworkers. I'm going to miss them.
