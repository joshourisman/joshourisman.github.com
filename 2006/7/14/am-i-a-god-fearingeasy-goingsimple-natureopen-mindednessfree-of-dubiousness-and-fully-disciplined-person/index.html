    [Edit: After some googling, I find it quite likely that we're currently being targeted by some <a href="http://truthhurts.org/articles/75/nigerian-roommate-scam/">counterfeit check scammers</a>. This could be fun. :)]

You may recall that I recently posted that some of the emails we've gotten about the room we're trying to rent out have been very strange to the point that I've almost suspected some of them of being some sort of scam. This trend has continued, and I just received one that I absolutely have to share.

<cite>Hello, 
I will like to know if tis room is available for rent,if its kindly let me have answer for the folowing question.
1) I will like to have the description of the room, size, and the 
equipments in there. 
2) I will like to have the rent fee per month plus the utilities. 
3) Also I will like to know if there is any garage or parking space cos I will have my own car come over. (BMW 5series)
4) I will also be coming with some of my belongings e.g shoe rack, book shelf and books, my electronics e.t.c
5) I will also like to know if I can make an advance payment ahead my arrival that will be stand as a kind of commitment that I am truely coming over and for you to hold the room down for me. 
I will like to know the total cost for the my initial move as in first month rent and if you accept deposit as soon as arriving 
first day i will pay u the balance.
7) I will like to know the major intersection nearest your neighborhood. like Shopping Mall, Store, Church e.t.c 
8) Lastly, I will like to know more about you and also I will like to have your pics as for me to know how my roommate to be looks like. I will be very glad to have all this questions answered with out leaving a stone unturned. My name is [no names, thankyou], I work currently in the field in Africa.Im working presently with my company JEK cons inc here in Africa.I had CCNA in certification and do hope
to end my current assignment soon .I hope to come down as soon as i do to explore my talent and love to have a more profitable job,I am presently in Africa and I will be moving to the states fully to live for the rest of my life I'm originally from Cortland Ney york and moved to Africa through My company. A Computer Consultant and I deal in various kind of computer applications and softwares. I graduated in Argosy University in Costa Rica 8 years ago and I have my B.sc in Computer Science.will be moving to the states fully to live for the rest of my life and start a new life and get my own business as a Computer Consultant ( I have my resume) I am a fearly mindedness person,easy going,transparency,free of dubiousness in nature, associate with open minded and trust worthy people.The nature of my profession keeps me busy all the time .In this wise i do not have time to host irrelevant friends or all sorts of indisciplinable association or engagement.It was quite fortunate of me to have seen the profile of your apartment displayed on the website i have been anxious to be linked up with this kind of opportunity.The fact is that i have decided to settle down here at home in America anytime from now(next week).Therefore,I need a god - fearing,easy going,simple nature,open mindedness,free of dubiousness and fully disciplined person to put up with as a co-tenant and landlord here in America. there fore I will be very glad to have all the above questions answered with out leaving a stone unturned Kindly get back to me</cite>

First off, most of the info asked for was included in the ad I posted, so those questions are just redundant (more on that later). Second, how and why does she plan on bring her beemer to Boston from Africa? Third, Shopping Malls, Stores, and Churches are not major intersections, although they may all float. Fourth, I have a hard time believe that the person who wrote this is from Cortland, New York, or anywhere else in an English-speaking country really. I think the rest really speaks for itself.

But what's <em>really</em> strange about this email, and what really makes me think there's got to be some sort of scam going on here, is that it's virtually identical to an email we received from someone claiming to be in Italy. Is there some sort of known scam going on here? That's really the most plausible explanation I can come up with. See for yourself:

<cite>Hey there,Am [no names],
I am writing just to confirm if you still have the room for rent,If YES Please I will like to have answers to the 
following questions below:

3) I will also be coming with some of my furniture, that is if the room is not funished and if furnitures are allowed, like bed, book shelf cos I read alot, shoe rank etc
4) I will like to have the description of the room, size, and the equipments in there.
5) I will also like to know if I can make an advance payment ahead my arrival that will be stand as a kind of commitment that I am truely coming over and for you to hold the room down for me.
