    So it's been brought to my attention that certain things on this blog may be getting misinterpreted by some people. For example the tone of my writing could be interpreted as hostile towards my current job and the countdown timer to my last day could be seen as evidence that I can't stand being here. That's not what I was getting at at all. I'm incredibly excited about everything that's going on, and it's true that I can't wait for July 21 to roll around, but it's not because I'm miserable where I am and hate being here it's because I'm excited about where I'm going. The countdown itself is really just a little toy I put up there because it was fun to code, and I think it emphasizes the fact that I'm under time constraints here. The rocketry reference also seems pretty appropriate, as my next steps will certainly be blasting me off into the unknown.

So yeah, nothing that I've written here was intended to be taken in a negative light at all. I'll admit that I may be getting a little anxious, but the last thing I want to do is come off as angry or vindictive.

In other news, you may have noticed a new addition to the side bar of my blog (assuming you bothered to scroll down and see it). It's a widget from <a href="http://bluedot.us/friends/dots">Blue Dot</a> a new social bookmarking site. It's still in beta, and there are some basic features that aren't there yet, but already I think I like it more than <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a>. I intend to write about it in a little more detail on <a href="http://tangent.nonhuman.net">my other blog</a> where it's a little more appropriate, but I thought I'd mention it here since I put the widget here.

Also, some of my coworkers were having fun today Googling their names and seeing what things their names were attached to. In the past, Googling my name hasn't been too relevant to me. But now, a search for "Josh Ourisman" will yield 1.5 pages of results before you see something that <em>isn't</em> directly relevant to me, the very first result being this blog. Cool, no?

Hopefully I should have some actually relevant news soon. Very hopefully it will involve me being able to say that arrangements for my move have actually been made...
