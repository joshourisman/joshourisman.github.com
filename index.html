    <p>Well, I should now have a working RSS feed again. Unfortunately, I don't actually know for sure whether or not this is the case due to some complications with FeedBurner. I started using FeedBurner for this blog in 2006, well before they were bought by Google, and never really got around to doing whatever things were required when that acquisition happened. As a result, my account was never properly transitioned. I attempted to do that the other day, but it would appear that not only do I not know my FeedBurner password, I don't even know my username or the email address I used to sign up for it. Everything I tried was rejected. So, I have no way of changing my settings leaving me with a choice between changing the URL of my RSS feed (an annoying solution for my subscribers), or attempting to rebuild my new, RabbitFish-based feed in-place to keep the FeedBurner feed going. I've attempted to go with the second option, and I suppose we'll know shortly how well that worked. Looking at my server logs, it appears that FeedBurner will update roughtly every 30 minutes, so it shouldn't take too long to ascertain whether or not the new feed is working properly. I guess we'll see in about 30 minutes!</p>

    </h1>
    <p>A few months ago I made some major changes to this blog. One of the obvious changes was the new design, based on <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a>, but in addition to that I also converted the blog from a <a href="http://djangoproject.com">Django</a> site to a static site. At that point, all I actually did was scrape the site to static files using wget and throw them up on the server to be hosted with <a href="http://nginx.net">Nginx</a>, but I've now taken that a step further.</p><p>For the past three months I've been working on a personal project named <a href="https://github.com/joshourisman/rabbitfish">RabbitFish</a>. It's a static site generator built on Python 3 that uses <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/">Jinja2</a> templates and <a href="http://www.yaml.org/">YAML</a> for storing configuration and content data. This blog is now powered by RabbitFish.</p><p>Largely because of the technical constraints of the still very immature state of RabbitFish, I've also made a few changes to the structure of the blog. Probably the most obvious is that I've gotten rid of the tag cloud that used to be in the right-hand sidebar. In addition, I've actually completely removed the tag system altogether. Of course, you'll notice that all the old posts, and this one as well, still have tags, but rather than being part of an actual tagging system, they're now basically just shortcuts for searching the blog; if you click on one, you'll see that it just takes you to the Google Custom Search for my blog with that tag filled in as the search query. Additionally, I've removed pretty much any way of navigating around the blog. Taking a page from Apple, I've decided to rely solely on search for finding blog posts. To ensure that all the posts get properly indexed, of course, I've also added a page that simply <a href="/all.html">lists all the blog posts</a>. (It's also linked to at the bottom of the index page.) Most of my traffic was organic search hits anyway, so I don't really see this causing any problems.</p><p>The one thing that I still have left to do is get syndication set up. Currently, the feed for everything prior to this post is still available thanks to FeedBurner, but I still need to set up a new, live feed to get new posts in there. Fortunately, that will be as easy as setting up a new ListPage in RabbitFish, and writing a template to build the appropriate XML file. I'll probably get that done this weekend.</p><p>Since I was already using <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> for comments, all the old comments are already here and new comments shouldn't be a problem. I'm realy interested to hear what people think about RabbitFish, as well as the minimal interface I'm exposing for the blog now.</p><p>RabbitFish: <a href="https://github.com/joshourisman/rabbitfish">https://github.com/joshourisman/rabbitfish</a></p>

      <a href="2010/6/5/adamanteus-05-released-now-more-postgresql/" rel="bookmark">Adamanteus 0.5 released, now with more PostgreSQL!</a>
      <br />
      <small>Jun 05, 2010</small>
    </h1>
    I've now finally gotten around to adding PostgreSQL support to <a href="http://bit.ly/bhEhPj">Adamanteus</a>! It wasn't really difficult, just hard to find time to do with everything that's been going on lately (quite busy at work and with the new house). The usage of Adamanteus hasn't changed at all, now you can just specify 'postgres' as your backend rather than just 'mongodb' or 'mysql'.

There is one slight caveat, however: the pg_dump utility does not allow you to provide a password non-interactively. For the time being, at least, that means that if you're using Adamanteus to back up a PostgreSQL database you can't specify a password (it will throw an exception if you do). The solution to this is to either 1) set up a read-only passwordless user for running backups, or 2) set up a .pgpass file on the machine from which you intend to run your backups (documentation <a href="http://bit.ly/91pFXF">here</a>). I recommend the .pgpass option, it's quick and easy.

Adamanteus 0.5 is available from both <a href="http://bit.ly/bhEhPj">bitbucket</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/c6p0F0">PyPi</a>.

      <a href="2010/3/26/adamanteus-versioned-database-backups/" rel="bookmark">Adamanteus: versioned backups of databases using Python and Mercurial</a>
      <br />
      <small>Mar 26, 2010</small>
    </h1>
    <p>Backing up databases is one of those things that I've always felt could be done in a better way. Traditionally I've done it with a simple shell script that used mysqldump or pg_dump to dump my database to an SQL file named using a timestamp, compress it, and maybe scp it off to some remote server for redundancy. This approach works just fine, except that I recently took a look at my backup directory for a project using that setup only to discover that there were nearly 5000 backup files taking up 11 GB (and this is using bzip2 to compress them!). Obviously not an optimal situation, especially considering that really very little changes from backup to backup, and it's quite possible that nothing changes at all for some of them. It simply makes no sense to store an entire dump of your database every single time!</p>

<p>Fortunately, this is a very familiar situation that we've got advanced tools to handle: version control systems. So I decided to write a little program to replace my shell script that would use a modern, advanced version control system to provide a much more reasonable solution. What I came up with was <a href="http://bitbucket.org/Josh/adamanteus/src/tip/adamanteus.py">Adamanteus</a>, a command line program written in Python that allows you to back up your database into a mercurial repository. It currently supports <a href="http://www.mongodb.org">MongoDB</a> and <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>, and I plan on adding <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> support this weekend.</p>

<p>Using Mercurial immediately solves basically all the problems with my original approach. It stores diffs rather than full files, meaning you aren't wasting space with a lot of duplicate information. It also handles compression transparently keeping the file sizes down even for the diffs. Plus, because Mercurial is a distributed version control system it's very easy to provide redundancy by pushing and pulling to and from remote repositories. (Pushing/pulling to/from remote repositories isn't currently implemented, but that's also in my plans for this weekend.)</p>

<p>The project is far from complete, but I think it's sufficiently far developed to release as 0.1. Plans for the 1.0 release include:
<ul><li>PostgreSQL support</li><li>The ability to restore your database from a particular revision in the repository</li><li>automated cloning/pushing/pulling of the repository</li><li>Integration with Django as a management command</li></ul>
I think this is actually pretty close and it probably won't take too long for me to implement all of those, so hopefully I'll be able to push out a 1.0 release very soon. The one other issue holding up 1.0 is that I'd like to wait for MongoDB 1.5 which will bring <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Import+Export+Tools#ImportExportTools-mongoexport">mongoxport</a> functionality in line with <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Import+Export+Tools#ImportExportTools-mongodump">mongodump</a> which is what I'm currently using. The issue here is that mongodump produces binary data files which don't play quite as nice with version control and lose you the advantage of only storing diffs. Mongoexport will export JSON or CSV files, which <em>will</em> allow it to take full advantage of Mercurial, <em>but</em> until 1.5 there's no easy way to use mongoexport to dump all the collections in a database which is the default behavior for mongodump.</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm definitely looking forward to some feedback on this project, as I suspect it could be quite useful to many people. Contributions are always welcome as well!</p>

      <br />
      <small>Mar 26, 2010</small>
    </h1>
    <p>Since <a href="http://joshourisman.com/2010/03/23/what-does-obamacare-actually-do/">my last post</a> I've seen quite a few other people writing about exactly the same issue with ObamaCare that I saw: it actually encourages people to <em>not</em> carry health insurance. The most recent is someone's whose blog I've been reading for a while and whose opinions I generally respect: <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/">Philip Greenspun</a> an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_Engineering_and_Computer_Science">EECS</a> professor at MIT. He actually did the math to reveal that a family in Massachusetts making $100,000 can expect to pay around $20,000 per year on insurance. The fine for not carrying insurance, however, would only be $2,000. And, of course, the insurance carriers would be forbidden from denying them of insurance if they showed up already sick and actually in need of health care.</p>

<p>But there's more! <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/authorbcaplan.html">Brian Caplan</a> at the <a href="http://www.econlib.org/">Library of Economics and Liberty</a> (which I don't actually know much about, but I would guess is biased in the libertarian direction from a cursory examination of the site) suggests another unexpected side-effect of ObamaCare will be that <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2010/03/how_many_employ.html#">employers will stop offering insurance as a benefit</a>. Part of the reason it's currently so common for insurance to be an employment benefit is that the government has been encouraging this behavior since around WWII by not counting health insurance as taxable income. This, apparently, is going to change with ObamaCare.</p>

<p>This, however, I think is actually a good thing. I mentioned in my last post that I had some ideas on a different sort of reform that I've posted about elsewhere in the past; below is an outline of some ideas that I put together a couple years ago (around the time that Massachusetts was debating the inspiration for ObamaCare):</p>

<p><ul><li>Decouple health insurance from employment</li><ul><li>current system economically stupid</li><ul><li>encourages un-educated consumers</li><li>reduces consumer choice</li><li>reduces competition in the market</li></ul><li>current system unnecessarily restricts consumers</li><ul><li>people with health problems can't change jobs for fear of losing insurance</li><li>true cost of insurance is hidden from consumers</li></ul></ul><li>Make medical costs tax deductible</li><ul><li>all costs should be up to 100% tax deductible (maybe variable by income)</li><li>makes health care significantly more affordable</li><li>provides the same functional assistance as a single-payer system</li><li>doesn't encourage reliance on the system</li><li>doesn't require increased bureaucracy</li><li>encourages personal responsibility</li></ul><li>Provide low/no interest loads to cover medical costs</li><ul><li>interest rate based on need</li><li>removes problem of non-payment</li><li>allows even the uninsured to afford very expensive procedures</li><li>doesn't encourage reliance on the system</li><li>payments are tax deductible under point 2</li></ul><li>Loosen regulations on insurance industry</li><ul><li>regulations such as setting a maximum deductible hurt both sides</li><ul><li>consumers aren't allowed to decide for themselves what they need</li><li>insurers aren't allowed to innovate and find new solutions</li></ul><li>regulations reduce competition</li><ul><li>not <em>all</em> of them!</li><li>regulations provide a disincentive for new insurance companies to enter the market</li><li>the more insurance companies there are, the better for consumers</li></ul></ul></ul></p>

<p>Obviously this is still rather rough, and some of the points are clearly designed to address things that have now changed. However I think this is a decent outline of changes that could be made to healthcare that would meet the goals of <em>both</em> sides of the public/private argument. I'm sure there's tons of discussion that could be had on just about every one of my points, so perhaps I'll take the time to break each one out into a separate blog post where I can go into more detail in the future. Also, I'll try and write some more about the code I've been working on as there's some good stuff involving <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a>, <a href="http://hmarr.com/2010/feb/04/introducing-mongoengine/">MongoEngine</a>, and&mdash;of course&mdash;<a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>.</p>
