      <a href="" rel="bookmark">Some braindead planning by the city of Somerville</a>
      <br />
      <small>Apr 29, 2008</small>
    </h1>
    So, currently there are signs up and down both sides of Somerville Ave. saying that there's no parking on those streets due to an 'emergency'. Well, that's all you can read of the signs as you drive around looking for parking due to the fact that everyone who usually parks on Somerville Ave. is now parked elsewhere, anyway. If, however, you take a closer look at those signs, they say that there's no parking there on 4/30 and 5/1 from 7:30 pm until 6:00 am or so because they're painting bike lanes.

Painting bike lanes? Bike lanes are great and all, and I wish there were more of them in general. But this is just an absolutely moronic way to go about it. The most obvious reason that it's a completely moronic thing to do is that Somerville Ave. is currently being re-paved. For the past, I don't know, 6 months or so, they've been very very very slowly working their way from Union Sq. towards Porter Sq. tearing up the roads and repaving them. Now this is definitely an essential thing for them to be doing as the state of Somerville Ave. is, in a word, abysmal. So, in general I heartily approve of both these measures.

The problem is that they're doing it in the wrong order. Unless they're planning on not fixing up <em>all</em> of Somerville Ave., which seems somewhat ridiculous since they're already investing time and money in the project and disrupting just about everyone's lives for it now, or they're planning on somehow, miraculously finishing the rest of Somerville Ave. tonight and tomorrow, they're just wasting a bunch of money here. They're going to spend the next two days painting bike lanes on the street only to tear it up and re-pave it in another month or so (if we're lucky).

This just strikes me as a tremendous waste of money. Also, it seems kind of odd for them to be painting bike lanes on a street that doesn't really have car lanes painted on it. I guess we're not really far enough away from Boston to escape the sphere of city planning moronicism.
